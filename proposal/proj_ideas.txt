Application: apply vision models into real-world problem - ConvNets
	- Data Preparation, Loss Function, Training, Cross-validation, Testing, and Model Comparisons
Retriction: involve pixels of visual data

Proposal:
	1. 200-400 words
	2. Problem, reading for background, data source, methodology and improvement, and evaluation (qualitative & quantitative)

Ideas: Brain MRI generation/synthesis, using Generative AI, based on the dataset of BraTS 2020
	1. GAN, Diffusion
